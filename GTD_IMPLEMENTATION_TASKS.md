## Projects Implementation

Projects are a key component of the GTD methodology for managing multi-step outcomes that require more than one action to complete. This section outlines the implementation plan for the Projects feature.

### Implementation Approach

The GTD Projects feature will be implemented using the following approach:

1. **Use existing task model**: We'll leverage the existing Task model with "project" status rather than creating a separate Project model
2. **Parent-child relationships**: Tasks can be associated with a project via the ProjectID field
3. **Progress tracking**: A project's progress will be calculated based on the completion status of its child tasks
4. **Separate interface**: Projects will have dedicated UI views while maintaining consistency with the rest of the app

1. **Projects View** ✅
   - ✅ Create dedicated Projects list page with project cards
   - ✅ Design project card with progress indicator and summary
   - ✅ Implement filtering and sorting options for projects
   - ✅ Add quick-add project button

2. **Project Detail View** ✅
   - ✅ Build project detail page showing project information
   - ✅ Implement next actions list associated with the project
   - ✅ Add project completion tracking and status indicators
   - ✅ Create project timeline/deadline visualization
   - ⬜ Add notes section for project planning

3. **Task-Project Relationship** ✅
   - ✅ Enhance task creation to allow assigning to a project
   - ✅ Create UI for moving tasks between projects
   - ✅ Implement child task creation within a project
   - ⬜ Add dependency tracking between project tasks (optional)

4. **Project Management** ✅
   - ✅ Implement project status transitions (active, on-hold, completed)
   - ✅ Add project archiving functionality
   - ⬜ Create project templates for recurring projects (optional)
   - ⬜ Implement project sharing/collaboration features (future)

## Technical Tasks

1. **Data Models** ✅
   - ✅ Implement Task model with GTD-specific fields
   - ✅ Create Project model with sub-tasks (via task status)
   - ✅ Design Context and Tag models

2. **User Interface** ✅
   - ✅ Build inbox processing view
   - ✅ Create list views for different GTD categories
   - ⬜ Implement drag-and-drop for organizing tasks
   - ✅ Design weekly review interface

3. **Backend Features**
   - ⬜ Implement authentication system
   - ✅ Create API endpoints for task management
   - ✅ Add recurring task functionality
   - ⬜ Build reminder system

4. **Deployment & DevOps**
   - ⬜ Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - ✅ Configure production environment (with Docker)
   - ✅ Implement backup system (via PostgreSQL integration)
